    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this project is to identify profitable Android (Google Play) and iOS (the App Store) mobile apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The apps in consideration are free to download and install, and the main source of the company's revenue consists of in-app ads. This means the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of its users - the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. Hence it is necessary to analyze available data to understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users both on Google Play and the App Store.\n",
    "## 1. Data Collection and Exploration\n",
    "As of [September 2018](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/), there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try first to analyze a sample of the data instead, to see if we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. For this purpose, there are 2 data sets available in the form of CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Android apps data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) contains data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018.\n",
    "- [IOS apps data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) contains data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. \n",
    "\n",
    "To open and explore these two data sets, a function `explore_data()` was created:"

    "- *Navigation* genre average number of ratings seems to be heavily influenced by 2 giant apps, Waze and Google Maps, while all the other apps show quite low numbers. It means that in this case average is not a good metric to use, since the distribution is heavily skewed. If to exclude these 2 dominant apps, the average becomes very low, which makes this genre less interesting for our purposes.\n",
    "- *Reference*. A similar situation is observed: average is influenced mostly by Bible and dictionaries, with a big gap with all the other apps of this genre.\n",
    "- *Social Networking*. Even though also here we see an obvious domination of Facebook and Pinterest, we can also note that there are many other social networks for different categories of people and interests, with rather high values of the average number of ratings. We remember also that entertainment apps are very popular on the App Store, and in particular among them social networks are not the most popular ones. Hence this market niche is probably not oversaturated, while the demand is still very high (since the need of communication is always present). Also, people usually spend a lot of time  on this genre of apps. They use them for leisure, being relaxed and open to new information, so there is more chance for an in-app ad to attract their attention.\n",
    "- *Music*. Like for the first 2 genres, the distribution for this one is skewed by several very popular apps. The rest of the apps mostly demonstrate quite low average number of ratings.\n",
    "- *Weather*. This genre doesn't seem particularly interesting for our purposes, since people generally don't spend too much time in-app, and the chances of making profit from in-app adds are low. Also, getting reliable live weather data may require connecting the app to non-free APIs. \n",
    "- *Book*. Here, practically, we have only 5 apps, if not to count few others, with extremely low average values. This niche is obviously undersaturated, which doesn't necessarily means a low demand. Finding some granular directions in this sphere (e.g. personal growth, psychology, business) and developing high-quality contents, we can attract probably not so large but pointedly interested audience, increasing in this way the chances of the app to become profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the most promising iOS app profiles seem to be **Social Networking** and **Book**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step is to provide an app profile recommendation for the **Google Play** market. We have data about the number of installs, so we should be able to get a clearer picture about genre popularity. However, the install numbers don't seem precise enough, with most values being open-ended (100+, 1,000+, 5,000+, etc.). We want to use these data anyway, after some cleaning: leaving the numbers as they are, removing commas and the plus characters, converting the numbers into `float` type."

    "This investigation reveals some insights for each of the most popular genres.\n",
    "- *COMMUNICATION* is oversaturated by numerous giant apps, with a big gap with all the others. This implies huge competition in given sphere, with very limited chance for newcomers. Apart from that, this category doesn't appear in a clear way among the genres of the App Store, and our aim is to recommend an app profile that shows potential for being profitable on both the App Store and Google Play.\n",
    "- *VIDEO_PLAYERS*, again, is oversaturated by some giant apps (even though fewer than the *COMMUNICATION* genre), with a big gap with all the others. Also, this category doesn't appear clearly among the genres of the App Store, only as a part of the *Photo & Video* genre, so it's impossible to compare these two genres in a direct way. In addition, the *Photo & Video* genre was not one of the most popular on the App Store.\n",
    "- *SOCIAL*. This category is also dominated by few famous apps like Facebook and Pinterest. However, some of these apps are quite specialized (LinkedIn used for work, Badoo for dating, etc), so their functions are different and the apps are not substitutable. Coming up with some interesting thematic social network could be a good idea for our apps, also because the average of the installs is still quite high even after excluding the giant apps. On the App Store we also found the corresponding genre *Social Networking* being highly potential. Hence this sphere can become profitable on both markets, which indeed is our ultimate goal.\n",
    "- *PHOTOGRAPHY* category shows high average number of installs  even after removing the giant apps. Despite this, and despite being one of the most common genres on both markets, it is not identified as one of the most popular genres on the App Store. In addition, this category is represented mostly by photo editors, presumably used mainly for work by professional photographers. This work requires high concentration, so in-app ads probably will not meet suitable target audience here.\n",
    "- *PRODUCTIVITY* genre is heavily dominated by famous apps. In addition, it doesn't result to be very popular on the App Store, even being among the most common ones.\n",
    "- *GAME*. This category is the most common on the App Store and the second common on Google Play. On Google Play it shows also hign number of installs after removing numerous giant apps. However on the App Store it is not particularly popular. Anyway, given certain potential of this genre, we can consider the idea of creating a game-based social network (since we have already defined this category as possibly profitable). It can be, for instance, an online quiz, quest, some other online games where the involvement of several teams (or several participants) currently available online is required. In this case, for being effective in capturing attention, the in-app ads should appear between games while people are waiting for the results and can percept a new information without being distracted from the game. \n",
    "- *TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL* category has very few (but strongly influencing the average number of installs) dominant apps, which are mostly about maps and hotels. According to our investigation of the most common genres, this category is in the middle in both data sets (the App Store and Google Play). Among the iOS apps, it is not particularly popular, so it  doesn't fit our purposes. However, we can use this idea for our apps: creating a social network related to travelling. For example, it can be an app dedicated to searching for co-travellers or a company to travel together, discussing itineraries, what to visit in a certain place, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we were investigating the app genres of the App Store, we defined as potential also the *Book* profile. For Google Play, the corresponding category (*BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE*) doesn't appear one of the most popular and, practically, is on the 11th place among the 33 categories. It could be also difficult to  extract from here some ideas for a social networking app. Hence to create apps profitable on both markets, books don't seem to be the best chioce.\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "All in all, after a thorough analysis of the most common and the most popular app genres of both datasets, the **SOCIAL NETWORKING** profile was suggested as the most interesting for our purposes, i.e. creating profitable free English apps with the revenue based on in-app ads for both the App Store and Google play. To stand out in the existing apps of this kind and to overcome the competition, a right theme has to be selected. As some possible ideas, it was proposed to create an online quiz, quest, some other online games with a lot of people/teams involved, or a social networking app dedicated to searching for co-travellers, discussing itineraries and places to visit."
